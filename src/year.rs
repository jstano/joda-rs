/// A wrapper struct representing a year as a 32-bit signed integer.
///
/// This struct provides a lightweight, type-safe abstraction for representing
/// years, ensuring that the value is always treated explicitly as a `Year`.
///
/// # Derivable Traits
/// - `Debug`: Enables formatting the `Year` using the `{:?}` formatter.
/// - `Clone`: Allows creating a copy of the `Year` struct.
/// - `Copy`: Allows bitwise copying of the `Year` since it is a simple value type.
/// - `PartialEq`: Enables equality comparisons between `Year` instances.
/// - `Eq`: Ensures that `Year` supports full equality comparison.
/// - `Hash`: Allows instances of `Year` to be hashed, enabling their use
///   in hashed collections like `HashMap` or `HashSet`.
/// - `PartialOrd`: Allows lexicographical ordering of `Year` values, supporting
///   partial ordering. For `Year`, this is effectively total ordering due to `i32`.
/// - `Ord`: Enables total ordering of `Year` values.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `0: i32` - The wrapped `i32` value representing the year.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use joda_rs::Year;
///
/// let year_2023 = Year::of(2023);
/// let year_1990 = Year::of(1990);
///
/// assert!(year_2023 > year_1990);
/// assert_eq!(year_2023.value(), 2023);
