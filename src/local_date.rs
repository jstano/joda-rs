    /// within the same month as the current date (`self`). To achieve this:
    /// 1. It retrieves the first day of the month using the `first_day_of_month` method.

    /// 3. It computes the difference (`delta`) between the specified `dow` and the day of the week of the first day,
    ///    ensuring the result is within the range of 0 to 6 days forward.
    /// 4. The function then advances the first day of the month by the calculated `delta` days
    ///    and returns the resulting date.
    ///
    /// ### Assumptions
    /// * It is assumed that the `DayOfWeek` type has a `value()` method that returns an integer representation
    ///   of the day of the week (e.g., Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, etc.).
    /// * The `first_day_of_month` method returns the date object representing the first day of the month.
    /// * The `plus_days` method advances the date by the specified number of days.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    /// ```rust
    /// let date = LocalDate::of(2023, 10, 15);
    /// let desired_dow = DayOfWeek::Monday;
    /// let first_monday = date.first_in_month(desired_dow);
    /// println!("The first Monday of the month is: {}", first_monday);
    /// ```
    ///

    /// - A new date (`Self`) representing the last occurrence of the specified day of the week

    /// # Implementation Details:
    /// - Calculates the last day of the current month (`last`).
    /// - Determines the day of the week of this last day (`current`).
    /// - Computes the backward difference (`delta`) between the current day of the week and the target day of the week (`dow`).
    /// - Adjusts the `last` date by subtracting `delta` days to obtain the desired last occurrence.
    ///
    /// # Assumptions:
    /// - The `self` object represents a valid date.
    /// - `DayOfWeek` provides the methods `.value()` to determine the numeric value of a day (for example, Monday = 1, Sunday = 7).
    ///

    /// - If the target day is the same as the day of the week of the last day of the month, no adjustment is made
    ///   and the same `last` day is returned.
    ///
    /// # Dependencies:
    /// - The function assumes the existence of:
    ///   - `last_day_of_month()` method that returns the last date of the month.
    ///   - `day_of_week()` method that returns the day of the week for the current date.
