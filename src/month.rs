/// Represents the months of the year as an enum with each variant corresponding to a specific month.
///
/// # Variants
/// - `January`: Represents the month of January, assigned the value `1`.
/// - `February`: Represents the month of February, assigned the value `2`.
/// - `March`: Represents the month of March, assigned the value `3`.
/// - `April`: Represents the month of April, assigned the value `4`.
/// - `May`: Represents the month of May, assigned the value `5`.
/// - `June`: Represents the month of June, assigned the value `6`.
/// - `July`: Represents the month of July, assigned the value `7`.
/// - `August`: Represents the month of August, assigned the value `8`.
/// - `September`: Represents the month of September, assigned the value `9`.
/// - `October`: Represents the month of October, assigned the value `10`.
/// - `November`: Represents the month of November, assigned the value `11`.
/// - `December`: Represents the month of December, assigned the value `12`.
///
/// # Traits
/// This enum derives the following traits:
/// - `Debug`: Allows the enumeration to be formatted using the `Debug` formatter.
/// - `Clone`: Allows the `Month` enum to be cloned.
/// - `Copy`: Enables the `Month` enum to implement copy semantics so that instances are duplicated implicitly
///   rather than moved.
/// - `PartialEq` and `Eq`: Enable comparison of `Month` instances for equality and inequality.
/// - `Hash`: Allows `Month` to be hashed, making it usable as keys in hash maps.
/// - `PartialOrd` and `Ord`: Enables comparison of `Month` instances for ordering purposes.
///
/// # Usage
/// Commonly used in scenarios where representing a specific month of the year is required:
///
/// ```
/// use joda_rs::Month;
///
/// let january = Month::January;
/// let december = Month::December;
///
/// assert_eq!(january.value(), 1);
/// assert!(january < december);
/// ```
