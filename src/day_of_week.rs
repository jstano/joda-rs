/// Represents the days of the week as an enumerated type.
///
/// This enum associates each day of the week with a corresponding integer value
/// (starting from 1 for `Monday` and ending with 7 for `Sunday`).
/// It derives several traits to enable common operations such as ordering, hashing,
/// equality checks, and debugging.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Monday`: Represents the first day of the week, assigned a value of 1.
/// - `Tuesday`: Represents the second day of the week, assigned a value of 2.
/// - `Wednesday`: Represents the third day of the week, assigned a value of 3.
/// - `Thursday`: Represents the fourth day of the week, assigned a value of 4.
/// - `Friday`: Represents the fifth day of the week, assigned a value of 5.
/// - `Saturday`: Represents the sixth day of the week, assigned a value of 6.
/// - `Sunday`: Represents the seventh day of the week, assigned a value of 7.
///
/// # Derivable Traits
///
/// - `Debug`: Automatically provides a human-readable string representation
///   of the enum for debugging purposes.
/// - `Clone`: Enables creating a duplicate of the enum instance.
/// - `Copy`: Allows the enum to be copied bitwise instead of moved, as it
///   is small and fixed in size.
/// - `PartialEq` and `Eq`: Enable comparison for equality and inequality.
/// - `Hash`: Allows the enum to be used in hashed collections like `HashSet`
///   or `HashMap`.
/// - `PartialOrd` and `Ord`: Provide comparison operations for ordering
///   (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use joda_rs::DayOfWeek;
///
/// let today = DayOfWeek::Wednesday;
/// println!("Day number: {}", today.value()); // Outputs: Day number: 3
/// ```
