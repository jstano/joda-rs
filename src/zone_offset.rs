    /// # Example Usage
    /// ```rust
    /// let utc_offset = ZoneOffset::UTC;
    /// println!("{:?}", utc_offset);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This can be useful when working with time zones or when needing

    ///   -23 to +23 (inclusive).

    ///   This can range from -23 to 23, where negative values represent time behind
    ///   UTC and positive values represent time ahead of UTC.

    ///   This can range from 0 to 59. Combined with `hours`, the total offset is
    ///   calculated as hours:minutes relative to UTC.

    /// let offset1 = ZoneOffset::of_hours_minutes(5, 30); // Represents a UTC offset of +05:30
    /// let offset2 = ZoneOffset::of_hours_minutes(-8, 0); // Represents a UTC offset of -08:00

    /// # Example
    /// ```
